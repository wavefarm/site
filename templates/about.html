  <h1>ABOUT WAVE FARM</h1> 

  <p>Wave Farm is a non-profit arts organization driven by experimentation with broadcast media and the airwaves. Our programs&mdash;Transmission Arts, WGXC-FM, and Media Arts Grants&mdash;provide access to transmission technologies and support artists and organizations that engage with media as an art form.</p>

<h2><a href="/ta">Transmission Arts</a></h2> Transmission Arts programs support artists who
engage the transmission spectrum, on the airwaves and through public
events. The Wave Farm Artist Residency Program is an international
visiting artist program. The Transmission Arts Archive presents a living
genealogy of artists’ experiments with broadcast media and the airwaves.
Wave Farm Radio is a continuous online radio feed and site-specific broadcast on 1620-AM.

  <h1>HISTORY</h1>
  <p>
  Wave Farm began in March 1997, as a microcasting collective in Brooklyn, NY called free103point9. free103point9 was an active participant in the U.S. microradio movement, an activist and advocacy effort that helped create this country’s low-power FM radio service, which provides a licensing opportunity for small broadcasters operating transmitters of 100 watts or less. 
  </p><p>
  From 1997 to 2004 free103point9 ran a venue for performance and experimental sound in South Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The “free103point9 Project Space” was home to a lively roster of artists working in noise, free jazz, electronic composition, and other experimental fringe genres. Many of these artists encountered microradio for the first time through free103point9. As a result, a local and international community of artists started to think conceptually about the transmission spectrum as a creative medium, becoming invested in a “hands-on” relationship with the airwaves. free103point9 launched an online radio station in 2001 engaging new and international audiences, and embarked on a series of radio experiments, projects, and performances internationally. 
  </p><p>
  That airwaves are public space and should therefore be accessible by the public, and that airwaves should be available for creative purposes, experimentation, and risk-taking is the ideology that has driven free103point9’s activities since its inception. In 2002-2003 free103point9 incorporated and secured 501(c)3 non-profit status, evolving from an artist collective to an arts organization whose mission is to define and cultivate Transmission Arts. 
  </p><p>
  In 2005, free103point9 expanded activities to Greene County, launching an artist-residency program, outdoor performance series, and installation park on a 30-acre property called Wave Farm. In 2006, free103point9 broke ground on a dedicated facility called the Wave Farm Study Center. 
  </p><p>
  free103point9 submitted an application to the FCC in October 2007 during a rare filing window for full-power non-commercial educational FM radio stations. A year later, on October 17, 2008, free103point9 received a construction permit to build a new FM station. The FM station was planned to serve both sides of the organization's roots: radio art and activism on the airwaves.
  </p><p>
  In June 2008, a Council of local advisors was established to guide the development of the station with regards to serving Greene and Columbia counties’ local community. Council members provided critical input in naming the station, identifying its guiding mission, and getting 90.7 FM off the ground and on the airwaves. 
  </p><p>
  In Fiscal Year 2009, free103point9 became a regrant partner of the New York State Council on the Arts, Electronic Media and Film, administering funds, ranging from 500 to 10,000, to dozens of New York State individual artists and organizations. 
  </p><p>
  In September 2010, WGXC partnered with the national radio advocacy organization <a href="http://www.prometheusradio.org/" target="_blank">Prometheus Radio Project</a> to host its first full-power FM barnraising in Hudson. The conference included three days of hands-on workshops, presentations, and performances, during which participants collaborated to build WGXC’s Hudson studio and help prepare the station for its FM signal launch. 
  </p><p>
  On February 26, 2011, WGXC went live on air at 90.7 FM. WGXC celebrated this momentous occasion with a live broadcast event at the <a href="http://www.catskillcommunitycenter.org/" target="_blank">Catskill Community Center</a>, which featured many of the station’s first on-air programmers. The WGXC Catskill studio began broadcasting in September 2011. 
  </p><p>
  In June 2012, the Wave Farm Study Center opened its doors to the public, reigniting free103point9 programs, such as Artists Residencies, the Transmission Arts Archive, and Online Radio that had become somewhat dormant while organizational resources were focused on launching WGXC. The Study Center is home to an international Artist-in-Residency Program, a library focused on transmission arts, WGXC’s Acra studio, and organizational administrative offices. 
  </p><p>
  In June 2013, as part of an organization-wide strategic planning process, Wave Farm was adopted as a commonly used organizational name, and in 2015 Wave Farm Inc. became the legal name of the organization.</p>
