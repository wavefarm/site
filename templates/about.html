  <h1>ABOUT WAVE FARM</h1> 
 
  <p>Wave Farm is a non-profit arts organization driven by experimentation with broadcast media and the airwaves. Our programs&mdash;Transmission Arts, WGXC-FM, and Media Arts Grants&mdash;provide access to transmission technologies and support artists and organizations that engage with media as an art form.</p>

<h2><a href="/ta">Transmission Arts</a></h2> Transmission Arts programs support artists engaging the transmission spectrum, on the airwaves and through public projects. The Wave Farm Artist Residency Program supports visiting artists from around the globe. Site-specific and interactive installations by artists activate and sonify the 29-acre Wave Farm property. The Transmission Arts Archive presents a living genealogy of artists’ experiments with broadcast media and the airwaves. Standing Wave Radio is a continuous online radio feed and site-specific broadcast on 1620-AM.
  <br />  
<h2><a href="/wgxc">WGXC 90.7-FM</a></h2> Wave Farm's WGXC 90.7-FM is a creative community radio station based in New York’s Greene and Columbia counties. Hands-on access and participation activate WGXC as a public platform for information, experimentation, and engagement.
  <br />  
<h2><a href="/mag">Media Arts Grants</a></h2> 

Wave Farm's Media Arts Grants program includes fiscal sponsorship as well as the New York State Council on the Arts in Partnership with Wave Farm: Media Arts Assistance Fund (MAAF) and New York Media Arts Map, which support electronic media and film organizations, as well as individual artists, in all regions of New York State through a regrant from the NYSCA Electronic Media and Film program.

  <h2>WGXC COMMUNITY ADVISORY COUNCIL</h2>

The WGXC Community Advisory Council is comprised of volunteers that serve on WGXC's Volunteer Advisory Committees. Management strives for the Community Advisory Council to reflect the diversity of potential listeners served within the WGXC 90.7-FM listening area.

 <!-- <h2>WAVE FARM RADIO ART PROGRAMMING COMMITTEE</h2>
  <p>This advisory committee supports Wave Farm's Artistic Director in making programming decisions. Membership is comprised of international and local individuals that have expertise and involvement relating to the Wave Farm Radio Art online station, including Transmission Arts and Experimental Sound programs airing on WGXC (Saturdays and midnight - 6 a.m., daily). The Artistic Director engages committee members as a group or individually, depending on the issues at hand, and reports on committee meetings to the Executive Director and the Board of Directors.</p> -->

 <a id="history"></a> <h1>HISTORY</h1>
  <p>
  Wave Farm began in March 1997, as a microcasting collective in Brooklyn, NY called free103point9. free103point9 was an active participant in the U.S. microradio movement, an activist and advocacy effort that helped create this country’s low-power FM radio service, which provides a licensing opportunity for small broadcasters operating transmitters of 100 watts or less. 
  </p><p>
  From 1997 to 2004 free103point9 ran a venue for performance and experimental sound in South Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The “free103point9 Project Space” was home to a lively roster of artists working in noise, free jazz, electronic composition, and other experimental fringe genres. Many of these artists encountered microradio for the first time through free103point9. As a result, a local and international community of artists started to think conceptually about the transmission spectrum as a creative medium, becoming invested in a “hands-on” relationship with the airwaves. free103point9 launched an online radio station in 2001 engaging new and international audiences, and embarked on a series of radio experiments, projects, and performances internationally. 
  </p><p>
  That airwaves are public space and should therefore be accessible by the public, and that airwaves should be available for creative purposes, experimentation, and risk-taking is the ideology that has driven free103point9’s activities since its inception. In 2002-2003 free103point9 incorporated and secured 501(c)3 non-profit status, evolving from an artist collective to an arts organization whose mission is to define and cultivate Transmission Arts. 
  </p><p>
  In 2005, free103point9 expanded activities to Greene County, launching an artist-residency program, outdoor performance series, and installation park on a 30-acre property called Wave Farm. In 2006, free103point9 broke ground on a dedicated facility called the Wave Farm Study Center. 
  </p><p>
  free103point9 submitted an application to the FCC in October 2007 during a rare filing window for full-power non-commercial educational FM radio stations. A year later, on October 17, 2008, free103point9 received a construction permit to build a new FM station. The FM station was planned to serve both sides of the organization's roots: radio art and activism on the airwaves.
  </p><p>
  In June 2008, a Council of local advisors was established to guide the development of the station with regards to serving Greene and Columbia counties’ local community. Council members provided critical input in naming the station, identifying its guiding values, and getting 90.7-FM off the ground and on the airwaves. 
  </p><p>
  In Fiscal Year 2009, free103point9 became a regrant partner of the <a href="http://www.nysca.org/" target="_blank">New York State Council on the Arts</a>, Electronic Media and Film Program, administering the distribution of grant funds, ranging from 500 to 10,000, to dozens of New York State individual artists and organizations annually. 
  </p><p>
  In September 2010, WGXC partnered with the national radio advocacy organization <a href="http://www.prometheusradio.org/" target="_blank">Prometheus Radio Project</a> to host a first full-power FM barnraising in Hudson. The conference included three days of hands-on workshops, presentations, and performances, during which participants collaborated to build WGXC’s Hudson studio and help prepare the station for its FM signal launch. 
  </p><p>
  On February 26, 2011, WGXC went live on air at 90.7-FM. WGXC celebrated this momentous occasion with a live broadcast event at the <a href="http://www.catskillcommunitycenter.org/" target="_blank">Catskill Community Center</a>, which featured many of the station’s first on-air programmers. 
  </p><p>
  In June 2012, the Wave Farm Study Center opened its doors to the public, reigniting free103point9 programs, such as the Wave Farm Residency Program, the Transmission Arts Archive, and Wave Farm Radio that had become somewhat dormant while organizational resources were focused on launching WGXC. 
  </p><p> 
  From 2013 to 2015, as part of an organization-wide strategic planning process, free103point9 began using Wave Farm as its organizational name and identity. And in 2016, Wave Farm's WGXC published <a href="/wgxc/about">A Manifesto for Participatory Radio,</a> which articulates the station's key belief system: Community, Creative Use of the Airwaves; Hands-on, two-way radio.</p>

<p>Wave Farm celebrated its 20th Anniversary year throughout 2017 with a series of very special events and live durational broadcasts including, <a href="calendar/marmc0">Wave Farm Pirate Radio Reunion Cruise</a> on Classic Harbor Line's Manhattan II yacht, March 7, 2017; <a href="/calendar/8d72rd">Audio Buffet (For Pauline Oliveros)</a>, July 22, 2017 at Wave Farm; and <a href="/calendar/h1vv4x">Wave Farm 1997-2017: Twenty Performances for Twenty Years</a>, October 21, 2017 at the Fridman Gallery in New York City.</p>
