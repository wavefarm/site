<h2>DONATE BY CHECK</h2>
<p>Checks should be made payable to: Wave Farm<br />
Mail to: 5662 Route 23, Acra, NY 12405.</p>

<h2>STOCK / SECURITIES DONATION</h2>
<p>Wave Farm is now able to accept donations of stock.<br /><br />
With a charitable gift of appreciated shares held long-term, the donation you make and the deduction you get are greater than they would be if you were to instead sell the shares and donate the cash proceeds. This is because when you donate shares, you avoid paying the capital gains tax.
For more information about making this type of donation to Wave Farmâ€™s WGXC, please contact Galen Joseph-Hunter galen [at] wavefarm.org or (518) 622-2598.</p>
