<h2>Stock/Securities Donations</h2>
<p>
Wave Farm is now able to accept donations of stock. With a charitable gift of appreciated shares held long-term, the donation you make and the deduction you get are greater than they would be if you were to instead sell the shares and donate the cash proceeds. This is because when you donate shares, you avoid paying the capital gains tax.

For more information about making this type of donation to Wave Farm or any of the programs listed below, please contact Galen Joseph-Hunter      <a href="mailto:galen@wavefarm.org">galen at wavefarm.org</a> or (518) 622-2598.
