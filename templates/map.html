<p>The Weather Warlock (Upstate edition) is one in a series of custom-built weather-controlled analog synthesizers. Outdoor sensors detect changes in sunlight, wind, precipitation, and temperature, with output becoming particularly dynamic during periods of rapid meteorological change, such as sunrise and sunset. At Wave Farm, Weather Warlock serves as a stand-alone installation and generative composition, an online stream, as well as an interactive instrument available to visiting artists and radio programmers.  
</p><p><i>
Weather Warlock at Wave Farm is made possible, in part, with support from the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts; the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of Governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York State Legislature; and the National Endowment for the Arts. Quintron developed Weather Warlock in 2014, while in residence at the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation. More information or live stream from an instrument in New Orleans at: <a href="http://www.weatherfortheblind.org" target="_new">weatherfortheblind.org</a>. </i></p>

</p>
<p>


Mobile 49 (M49) is a research/production facility, which serves as a central component in Max Goldfarb’s recent work. The Deep Cycle project, was an area-responsive mobile radio program, originating in Hudson, New York, proceeding through a set of designated locations for performative incidents, and arriving at Wave Farm. Regenerator describes M49 installed at Wave Farm. The vehicle houses Wave Farm Radio 1620-AM, and is open to public visitors, both as an performance artifact and as an active studio environment.

<p>The SURVANT USB Dead Drop is an open-source file
repository located off of the forested path. Inspired by
Aaron Swartz’s various hacktivistic dead drop projects,
SURVANT aims to function as both an archive and a remixological
tool. </p>

<p>Japanther’s Remote Audio Outpost is a solar-powered
recording booth, outfitted with a rotary phone wired by
Cablesmith (Jason Rutherford) for both recording and
transmission. Installed in one of the most remote corners
of the Wave Farm property, it is a place for introspection
and confession. </p>

<p>Outernet Library Branch–Wave Farm features a satellite dish antenna surrounded by Adirondack-chair-inspired seating, with a bench oriented toward each cardinal direction. The WiFi network access area is defined by a large mowed meadow. In addition to seating, the structure houses a box for electronics and a single physical library reference book located under the east bench. On entering the library area and perhaps taking a seat, a library branch visitor may read, view, listen to, and save library materials using a browser on their cell phone, tablet or computer. To browse these Outernet library files transmitted from the Galaxy 19 satellite, connect to the "Outernet" WiFi network and then visit http://librarian.outernet.
