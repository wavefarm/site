</p>
<p>Mobile 49 (M49) is an experimental research/production
facility, which serves as a central component in Max Goldfarb’s
recent work. The Deep Cycle project, was an area-
responsive mobile radio program, originating in Hudson,
New York, proceeding through a set of designated
locations for performance and incidents, and arriving at
Wave Farm. Regenerator describes M49 installed at Wave
Farm. The vehicle houses Wave Farm Radio 1620-AM, and
is open to public visitors, both as an performance artifact
and as an active studio environment.</p>

<p>The SURVANT USB Dead Drop is an open-source file
repository located off of the forested path. Inspired by
Aaron Swartz’s various hacktivistic dead drop projects,
SURVANT aims to function as both an archive and a remixological
tool. </p>

<a href="/archive/zhngsv"><img src="http://data.free103point9.org/r/zh/ng/sv/japanther_outpost.jpeg" height="275"></a>
<p>Japanther’s Remote Audio Outpost is a solar-powered
recording booth, outfitted with a rotary phone wired by
Cablesmith (Jason Rutherford) for both recording and
transmission. Installed in one of the most remote corners
of the Wave Farm property, it is a place for introspection
and confession. </p>

<p>Outernet Library Branch–Wave Farm features a satellite dish antenna surrounded by Adirondack-chair-inspired seating, with a bench oriented toward each cardinal direction. The WiFi network access area is defined by a large mowed meadow. In addition to seating, the structure houses a box for electronics and a single physical library reference book located under the east bench. On entering the library area and perhaps taking a seat, a library branch visitor may read, view, listen to, and save library materials using a browser on their cell phone, tablet or computer. To browse these Outernet library files transmitted from the Galaxy 19 satellite, connect to the "Outernet" WiFi network and then visit http://librarian.outernet.
