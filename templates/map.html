<p>
Zach Poff's Pond Station transmits the hidden activity within this freshwater pond from dawn until sundown. The sound transmitted is broadcast to local listeners on Wave Farm Radio 1620-AM and Wave Farm's WGXC 90.7-FM, and streamed online to international audiences. In addition, Pond Station serves as a live, generative, natural instrument for Wave Farm resident artists who may remix and interpret these otherwise inaccessible environmental sounds in their own work.

</p>
<p>Mobile 49 (M49) is an experimental research/production facility, which serves as a central component in Max Goldfarb's recent body of work.
</p><p>
The Deep Cycle project, was an area-responsive mobile radio program, originating in Hudson, NY, proceeding through a set of designated locations for performance and incidents, and arriving at Wave Farm. The Deep Cycle publication documents the June 2010 procession and features contributions from Goldfarb's collaborating artists, writers, designers and theorists, that address the subject of a post-oil landscape: consumption, waste, transit, energy, transformation, and disaster. 
</p><p>
Regenerator, describes M49 installed at Wave Farm. The vehicle houses a site-specific AM radio station, Wave Farm Radio 1620-AM, and is open to public visitors, both as an performance artifact and as an active studio environment. </p>

<a href="/archive/sae7by5"><img src="http://data.free103point9.org/r/f8/r8/0k/DSC_0265.JPG" height="275"></a>
<p>The SURVANT USB Dead Drop is an open-source file repository located off of the forested path at Wave Farm. Inspired by Aaron Swartz's various hacktivistic dead drop projects, the SURVANT USB Dead Drop aims to function as both an archive and a remixological tool to be used by Wave Farm visitors and artists-in-residence. The precise location of the drop is intentionally kept secret to maintain the offline network's integrity and activistic power. </p>

<h2><a id="japanther"></a><a href="/ta/works/0ypzb8">4. Remote Audio Outpost, by Japanther.</a></h2>
<a href="/archive/zhngsv"><img src="http://data.free103point9.org/r/zh/ng/sv/japanther_outpost.jpeg" height="275"></a>
<p>Japanther's Remote Audio Outpost is a solar-powered recording booth, outfitted with a rotary phone wired by Cablesmith (Jason Rutherford) for both recording and transmission. Installed in one of the most remote corners of the Wave Farm property, Remote Audio Outpost is a place for introspection and confession.  
</p><p>
This project was realized through the collaboration of Jason Rutherford and Gardener Allen. </p>
