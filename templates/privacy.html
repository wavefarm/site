  <h1>Wave Farm Privacy Policy and Terms of Service</h1>

  <h2>Wave Farm Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy explains the types of information we collect through our websites on which this Privacy Policy is posted (each, a “Site”), how we will use, disclose and protect this information once it is collected, and how you can opt-out of some of our uses of your information.
  </p><p>
By visiting our Site, you agree to the terms of this Policy as they may be amended from time to time. Here are a few general principles to keep in mind as you read through this Privacy Policy: 
    </p><p>
The Site is owned and operated by Wave Farm Inc., or one of the programs (referred to collectively in this policy as “we,” “us,” “our,” and other similar pronouns). 
  </p><p>
This Privacy Policy does not apply to and is not directed at children under the age 13. Children under 13 are not authorized to use the Site. By logging onto and using the Site, you affirm that you are 13 years of age or older. 
  </p><p>
This Policy is incorporated into, and part of, our Terms of Use, which govern your use of the Site as a whole. 
  </p><p>
This Policy does not apply to information that you may provide to us, or that we may obtain, other than through our Site, such as over the phone, by mail, or in person. 
  </p><p>
If you are located outside of the United States, you should know that the information you provide to us is being transmitted to us and processed in the United States and will be protected subject to this Privacy Policy and United States laws, which may not be as protective as the laws in your country. Also, this Site places cookies and local shared objects on your computer or device, which are further described below. By using the Site, you agree to this.
  </p><p>
  <b>Opt Out</b>
  </p><p>
You may tell us that you do not want to receive communications from us, by sending us an e-mail with a subject matter of “unsubscribe” to info@wavefarm.org. Please understand that it may take us a few days to process any opt out request and that even if you opt out of receiving promotional correspondence from us, we may still contact you in connection with your relationship, activities, transactions and other communications with us.
  </p><p>
  <b>What information is collected on this Site?</b>
  </p><p>
  <b>User-Provided Information</b>
  </p><p>
“Personal Information” is information that can be used to identify you as an individual or allow someone to contact you, as well as information attributed with such information. We collect Personal Information such as your name, postal addresses, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, credit card and/or debit card information, and instant messaging addresses. For example, we collect Personal Information when you conduct a transaction on our Site, create an account on our Site, sign up to receive e-mails or newsletters from us, complete surveys, contribute to a chat room, bulletin board, list serve, blog, wiki or other social forum on the Site, or submit a comment or question to us using a “contact us” or similar feature on the Site.
  </p><p>
    <b>Site Usage Information</b>
  </p><p>
As is the case with many websites, our servers automatically collect your IP address when you visit the Site, and we may associate that with your domain name or that of your Internet access provider.
  </p><p>
We may also capture certain “clickstream data” pertaining to your Site usage. Clickstream data includes, for example, information about your computer or device, web browser and operating system and their settings, the referring page that linked you to the Site, the pages or ads you see or click on during your visit and when and for how long you do so, items you download, the next website you visit when you leave the Site, and any search terms you have entered on the Site or a referral site.
  </p><p>
In addition, we may deploy various tracking technologies on the Site to collect additional information about your Site visits.
  </p><p>
For example: 
  </p><p>
Cookies are small data files stored on your computer or device at the request of a website. A cookie may enable us to recognize you as the same user who was at our Site in the past, and relate your use of the Site to other information about you, such as your Site usage information and Personal Information. Cookies may also be used to enhance your experience on the Site (for example, by storing your username) or to collect general usage and aggregated statistical information. Most browsers can be set to detect cookies and give you an opportunity to reject them, but refusing cookies may, in some cases, inhibit or preclude your use of the Site or its features. 
  </p><p>
Local shared objects, such as “Flash cookies,” may be stored on your computer or device using a media player or other software installed on your computer or device. Local shared objects operate a lot like cookies, but cannot be managed in the same way. Depending on how local shared objects are enabled on your computer or device, you may be able to manage them using software settings. 
  </p><p>
HTML5 (the language some websites are coded in) may be used to store information on your computer or device about your Site usage activities. This information may be retrieved by us to determine how our Site is being used by our visitors, how it can be improved, and to customize it for our users. 
  </p><p>
Cache cookies, such as “eTags,” may be used to identify your computer or device as the same computer or device that visited our Site or another website in the past. • Browser history sniffing may be used to enable us to detect whether you have visited a webpage of ours or of someone else’s in the past by determining whether its URL is located in the list of URLs stored in your web browser’s history file. 
  </p><p>
Browser fingerprinting can enable us to recognize your computer or device as the same one that has been used to visit our Site in the past based on various detectable information from your computer or device that, together, can be used as a “fingerprint” of your computer or device. 
      </p><p>
A pixel tag (also known as a “clear GIF” or “web beacon”) is a tiny image – typically just onepixel – that can be placed on a webpage or in our electronic communications to you in order to help us measure the effectiveness of our content by, for example, counting the number of individuals who visit us online or verifying whether you’ve opened one of our emails or seen one of our webpages.
  </p><p>
These tracking technologies may be deployed by us and/or by our service providers or partners on our behalf. These technologies enable us to and relate your Site usage information to other information about you, including your Personal Information. By using our Site, you agree to our use of these tracking technologies.
  </p><p>
    <b>How is your information used?</b>
  </p><p>
We may use the information we collect from and about you to perform the following business functions: 
    <li>processing and fulfilling your transactions </li>
<li>administering the Site and your account with us, if any </li>
<li>responding to your requests, questions, and concerns </li>
<li>developing new features and offerings on the Site </li>
<li>sending you information and updates, including information about organizational programs, activities, products, services, events, and opportunities that we think might interest you </li>
<li>protecting our rights and property </li>
<li>tailoring information displayed to you on our Site and elsewhere to your interests and history with us</li>
  </p><p>
To perform the above functions, we may match information collected from you through different means or at different times, including both Personal Information and Site usage information, and use such information along with information obtained from other sources (including third parties) such as demographic information and updated contact information. We may also use your information to assess the level of interest in, and use of, the Site, our e-mails and our other messaging campaigns both on an individual basis and in the aggregate.
  </p><p>
    <b>Social Networking</b>
  </p><p>
We may maintain presence on several social networking and blogging platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, Wave Farm, and we also may incorporate some third party social networking features onto our Site. Through these platforms and features, we receive some Personal Information and some Site usage information about you, and this Privacy Policy applies to that information as well, to the extent we collect it ourselves. Keep in mind that third party social networking platforms have their own privacy policies which explain how the third parties that provide them will use and protect your information, separately from this Privacy Policy.
  </p><p>
    <b>Do we share Personal Information and Site usage Information with others?</b>
  </p><p>
Yes. We may share the information with third parties who need your information in order to provide services to us (or on our behalf). We may also share what you voluntarily post to public areas on the Site with other Site users. Finally, we may also share information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or property, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud or respond to a government, judicial or other legal request, or to comply with the law.
  </p><p>
In addition, we may share non-personally identifiable Site usage information (including aggregate data) with others in a form that does not include your name or contact information.
  </p><p>
    <b>Wireless Addresses</b>
  </p><p>
If the e-mail address you provide to us is a wireless e-mail address, you agree to receive messages from us at such address unless and until you tell us not to send messages to that address, by following the instructions in the Opt-out section above. You may change your e-mail preferences at any time, but your wireless carrier’s standard rates will apply as long as you are receiving messages at a wireless e-mail address. If you give us a wireless e-mail address, you represent that you are the owner or authorized user of the device on which messages will be received and that you are authorized to approve the applicable charges.
  </p><p>
    <b>Public Forums</b>
  </p><p>
When you contribute to a public area or feature of our Site, such as a chat room, bulletin board, list serve, blog, wiki or other communication or community tool or area, the information that you submit or post will be made available to the general public. For this reason, we recommend that you do not submit any sensitive information, including your name, home address, phone number, or other information that would enable other users to locate you, or financial information on these areas of our Site.
  </p><p>
    <b>Security</b>
  </p><p>
While we endeavor to protect the security and integrity of sensitive Personal Information collected on this Site, we cannot guarantee that information will be absolutely safe from intrusion during transmission, while stored on our system, or when otherwise in our care. If you correspond with us by e-mail, or using the “Contact Us” feature on the Site (if available), you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure. A third party could view the information you send in transit. We will have no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission. If we make this feature available and you create an account on our Site, you are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your account password, and you shall be responsible for any activity that occurs using your account credentials, whether or not you authorized such activity. Please notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security. If we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our care may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we will endeavor to notify you as promptly as possible under the circumstances at the mailing address we have on record for you.
  </p><p>
    <b>“Linked-To” Web Sites</b>
  </p><p>
The Site may contain links, banners, widgets or advertisements that lead to other websites. We are not responsible for these other sites, and so their posted privacy policies (not this Privacy Policy) will govern the collection and use of your information on them. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each website visited after leaving the Site to learn about how your information is treated by others.
  </p><p>
 <b>Phishing </b>
  </p><p>
Phishing attacks attempt to steal consumers’ personal identity data and financial account credentials. “Phishers” use “spoofed” e-mails to lead consumers to counterfeit websites designed to trick recipients into divulging sensitive Personal Information such as credit card numbers, account usernames, passwords, and Social Security Numbers. WE DO NOT SEND E-MAILS ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE OR CONFIRM SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION OR YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD! If you receive such e-mail communication, please forward it immediately to the Site’s Privacy Administrator at [info@wavefarm.org], and then immediately delete the fraudulent e-mail from your computer.
  </p><p>
 <b>Consent to Processing </b>
  </p><p>
By providing Personal Information to this Site, you consent to the collection, maintenance, processing and transfer of such information in and to the United States and other countries and territories, pursuant to the laws of the United States, which may provide lesser privacy protections than the laws of other countries.
  </p><p>
 <b>Changes to this Privacy Policy </b>
  </p><p>
We may change this Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post the changed Privacy Policy on this page. In some cases, we may also tell you about changes by additional means, such as by sending an e-mail to the e-mail address we have on file for you.
