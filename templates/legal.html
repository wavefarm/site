These Terms of Use, and the relationship between you and us, will be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of New York, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

</p><p>
Binding Arbitration 
</p><p>
Unless you opt out, you are agreeing to resolve certain disputes through arbitration. THE BINDING ARIBITRATION CLAUSE BELOW SAYS THAT YOU AND US AGREE TO RESOLVE CERTAIN DISPUTES THROUGH ARBITRATION. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THIS PART OF THESE TERMS OF USE. PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND OUR BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND HOW YOU CAN OPT OUT OF IT. 
<br />Our goal is to resolve Disputes fairly and quickly. (A “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and us regarding any aspect of your relationship with us.) However, if we cannot resolve a Dispute with you, then, except as described elsewhere below, each of us agrees to submit the Dispute to the American Arbitration Association for resolution under its Commercial Arbitration Rules or, by separate mutual agreement, to another arbitration institution. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local “small claims” court, if its rules permit it. 
<br />You may bring claims only on your own behalf, and not on behalf of any official or other person, or any class of people. Only claims for money damages may be submitted to arbitration; claims for injunctive orders or similar relief must be brought in a court. You may not combine a claim that is subject to arbitration under these terms and conditions with a claim that is not eligible for arbitration under these terms and conditions. The arbitrator will decide whether a dispute can be arbitrated. 
<br />The arbitrator will issue an award decision in writing but will not provide an explanation for the award unless you or we request one. Any arbitration award over $75,000 may be appealed to a three-person panel appointed by the same arbitration institution that rendered the original award. Any such appeal must be filed within 30 days and the appeal will be decided, based on that institution’s appeal rules, within 120 days of filing. 
<br />Before you initiate an arbitration proceeding, you may request that we advance on your behalf (1) the arbitration filing fees (but only to the extent they exceed your local small claims court filing fees) and (2) the portion of the arbitrator’s costs for which you would normally be responsible. If we win the arbitration, you will reimburse us for these advances. We will, of course, pay any fees or costs required under the law where you live. 
<br />You may opt out of this arbitration provision. If you do so, neither you nor we can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify us in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision. You must use one this address to opt out:
</p><p>
Galen Joseph-Hunter<br />
Executive Director<br />
Wave Farm (free103point9 Inc.)<br />
Route 23, Acra, NY 12405<br />
Attn: Arbitration Opt-out 
</p><p>
You must include your name, address, the URL of this arbitration provision, and a clear statement that you wish to opt out of this arbitration provision in these terms and conditions. 
</p><p>
If the prohibition against class action and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained in this Section is found to be unenforceable, then all of this arbitration provision will be null and void. This arbitration provision will survive these Terms of Use and the termination of your use of this site. 
</p><p>
