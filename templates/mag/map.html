<h1>NY MEDIA ARTS MAP (Launch Date: July 23, 2015)</h1>

  <p><a href="http://nymediaartsmap.org/">http://nymediaartsmap.org/</a></p>

<p>Designed for cultural organizations, artists, and the general public, the New York Media Arts Map features organizations with a deep commitment to media art and to technology as an art form.
</p><p>
The Map is a vital tool for identifying art and technology networks, services and opportunities throughout New York State, connecting us to each other and to essential information about Media Arts statewide.
</p><p>
The Map features a variety of resources including a funding calendar, consultant directory and convening archive. The Map also identifies contemporary media art activities, events and initiatives on a local and regional scale, representing a broad spectrum of independent media practice.
</p><p>

Newly re-launching in 2015 by current host organization Wave Farm, the Map is the result of a three year study on the sustainability and impact of independent media arts organizations in New York State. The Map was first conceptualized in 2008 by the New York State Council on the Arts Electronic Media and Film Program in collaboration with American Documentary/P.O.V. and the Experimental Television Center. Rhizome served as the first host organization from 2009-2013. In 2014, Wave Farm became the new Mapâ€™s host organization and project partner.
</p><p>
<i>The Map is a project of the NYSCA Electronic Media & Film Program, funded by the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of Governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York State Legislature.</i>
