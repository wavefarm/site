 <h2>ABOUT  MAAF  FOR  ARTISTS</h2>
 <p>
  For  individual  artists,  the  New  York  State  Council  on  the  Arts  in  Partnership  with  Wave  Farm:  Media  Arts  Assistance  Fund  (MAAF)  provides  support  for  the  distribution  and  exhibition,  as  well  as  completion  of  works  in  all  genres  of  sound  and  moving  image  art,  including  emergent  technology.  Grant  awards  assist  artists  in  completing  new  work,  reaching  public  audiences,  and  advance  artistic  exploration  and  public  engagement  in  the  media  arts. 
 </p><p>
 For  the  purposes  of  these  grants,  MAAF  considers  Media  Arts  as  moving  image  and  sound  art  works.    MAAF  is  not  able  to  support  the  completion  or  distribution/exhibition  of  works  that  employ  the  media  arts  in  service  of  another  discipline,  or  in  creative  expression  through  science  and  technology  such  as  BioArt,  including  the  environmental  arts  per  se.    Although  MAAF  recognizes  moving  image  and  sound  art  works  may  incorporate  these  elements,  proposals  that  focus  solely  on  the  environmental/bio  sciences  as  the  artistic  center-piece  will  not  be  considered  at  this  time.    
 </p>
 
 <h2>Completion  Support  –  for  MAAF  Artists  </h2>
  <p>The  goal  of  MAAF  Completion  Support  is  to  ensure  completed  works  are  experienced  by  public  audiences.  Funds  are  available  for  projects  that  demonstrate  a  practical  proposal  leading  to  the  distribution/exhibition  of  that  work.  The  successful  applicant  will  detail  the  completion  plan,  including  a  description  of  potential  distribution  modes  and/or  potential  exhibition  opportunities,  including  the  intended  audience(s)  and  final  format(s)  appropriate  for  the  intended  public  presentation.    
  </p>
