<h1>FOR NYS MEDIA ARTISTS</h1>
<p>
For individual artists, the The Media Arts Assistance Fund provides support for the distribution
and exhibition of works in all genres of time-based and moving image
media, including emergent technology. Grant awards assist artists in
making recently completed works available to public audiences, and
advance artistic exploration and public engagement in the media arts.
</p><p>
A regrant program for
the New York State Council on the Arts, Electronic Media and Film,
grant awards assist artists in meeting expenses such as: duplication
of preview, screening, and exhibition copies; promotional materials
including documentation and schematics of media-installation and
new-media works. Project
mentors provide grantees with expert guidance as they execute their distribution
and exhibition plans. Artists
may request funding support up to a maximum amount of $10,000.
