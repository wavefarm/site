<h1>Programmer Basics</h1>
    <h2><a id="volunteer"></a>Volunteer Requirements</h2>
    <p>Programmers are expected to participate in the organization and maintain an active status as a volunteer, completing at least six hours of volunteer service each year. The time a programmer spends on-air or otherwise producing their show does not count toward this requirement.• Volunteer time can be completed in a variety of ways to benefit the station. Common volunteer opportunities include, but are not limited to: Participation in one of the various clerical, library, or housekeeping tasks within the station; additional participation in on-air pledge drives; and/or training and skill-sharing with other programmers. 
</p><p>
*Syndicated programs not produced at a WGXC studio are exempt from this requirement.
</p>
    <h2><a id="communication"></a>Communication</h2>
    <p>WGXC Staff Points of Contact</p><p>
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Station Manager: Lynn Sloneker <br />
lynn@wgxc.org (518) 697-7400 (Mon, Tues, Wed, Thurs) <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Program Director: Katy Donnelly <br />

Programmer Listserv
</p><p>
WGXC currently maintains an e-mail listserv for use by all eligible programmers. Programmers become eligible for list membership after the completion of basic on-air training. Use of the list is optional. The list is a tool for communication, providing a venue to post questions and ideas and to share information and resources. It is administered by WGXC staff. 
</p><p>
Forwards, other spam-like email, or messages unrelated to WGXC business are not permitted. If a post is found to be inappropriate for the forum, staff will contact the user directly. Consistent and ongoing abuse of the listserv rules will lead to the loss of list privileges. 
</p><p>
Examples of appropriate use of the list:<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Communication between programmers about upcoming on-air guests, topics and interviews. <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharing of information about WGXC-related events. <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recruiting fill-in hosts during hiatus or vacations. 
</p>
    <h2><a id="music"></a>Music Reporting</h2>
    <p>For a two-week period every three months, we must keep a detailed and comprehensive report of the music played on 90.7 FM for music licensing purposes. Instructions and basic training will be provided to each programmer. Programmers are informed in advance of when WGXC is entering a comprehensive music-reporting period. </p>
    <h2><a id="pledge"></a>Pledge Drives</h2>
    <p>
    WGXC holds a minimum of two, 10-day, on-air pledge drives per year. This is how the organization raises the bulk of its operating expenses. Programmers are required to participate in the on-air fundraising effort during their regular show time. 
    </p><p>
Programmers must be prepared to fundraise for a minimum of half of the show’s length. While the time spent on air does not count as volunteer time, discussed in this handbook’s Volunteer section, if it is a part of a programmer’s regularly scheduled broadcast, pledge drives provide the opportunity for programmers to help out in other ways as well. 
    </p><p>
Volunteering at other times during the pledge drive — to pitch on the air, answer phones, etc. — is expected. Programmers are also asked to make an effort to identify people to call in and pledge during their show. In the weeks leading up to pledge drives, trainings are held to prepare programmers for on-air fundraising. 
    </p><p>
During each pledge drive, volunteers — including WGXC staff and Council — will step forward to assist programmers with pitching on air, handling phones, and coordinating other volunteers. 
    </p><p>
Pledging during syndicated programming on WGXC: producers of syndicated programming airing on WGXC are encouraged to produce PSAs or include a mention of WGXC’s Pledge Drive in programs airing during Pledge Drives.   
    </p>
    <h2><a id="terms"></a>Program Terms</h2>
    <p>All programmers are given a term of one year. All programmers, in good-standing, are invited to participate in a simple reapplication process at the end of their term in order to continue as an active program for an additional term. Programmers in good standing have completed their required annual volunteer hours, have not incurred more than three warning points, or otherwise violated the policies in this document. </p>
    <h2><a id="security"></a>Security & Equipment</h2>
    <p>
    The programmer is integral to maintaining the security of WGXC’s equipment and spaces. Programmers may ask visitors to identify themselves and to disclose the reasons for being in the studio. Programmers may also ask a visitor to leave if they have no legitimate reason for being there. Programmers are expected to be courteous to one another and to staff. Staff or volunteers on site should be advised when programmers arrive and leave the station. 
</p><p>
It is very important to leave the studio in suitable shape for the programmers that follow you, and the station must be left secure. There is a shutdown checklist posted in each studio, which involves a variety of tasks, from common-sense tidiness to station security. Failure to follow these procedures could constitute, at best, a nuisance for other programmers and, at worst, a major security or property damage risk for the station. 
</p><p>
Whether you are prerecording or doing a live show, we ask that you leave the studio tidy and the equipment ready for the next program/programmer by doing the following. 
</p><p>
