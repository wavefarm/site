  <h1>WGXC COMMUNITY ADVISORY COUNCIL</h1>
  <p>
The WGXC Community Advisory Council is comprised of volunteers that serve on the various WGXC Volunteer Advisory Committees. Members of the Community Advisory Council support station management by offering a representative voice of the community and active participation on at least one and no more than two of the Volunteer Advisory Committees of Fundraising, Outreach, Programming, and Policy. The collective body of these committees shall be known as the WGXC Community Advisory Council. The Advisory Council and its committees serve solely at the pleasure of management and are therefore not Committees of the Board nor Committees of the Corporation. Full descriptions of each committee, as well as their regular meeting schedules can be found <a href="https://dev.wavefarm.org/wgxc/volunteer#committees">here</a></a>.</p><p>

  <h1>History</h1>
  <p>
  free103point9 Inc. (aka Wave Farm) submitted an application to the FCC in October 2007 during a rare filing window for full-power non-commercial educational FM radio stations. A year later, on October 17, 2008, free103point9 received a construction permit to build a new FM station. The FM station was planned to serve both sides of the organization's roots: radio art and activism on the airwaves.
  </p><p>
  In June 2008, a Council of local advisors was established to guide the development of the station with regards to serving Greene and Columbia counties’ local community. Council members provided critical input in naming the station, identifying its guiding mission, and getting 90.7-FM off the ground and on the airwaves. 
  </p><p>
  WGXC Online Radio began broadcasting at wgxc.org on May 9, 2009, live from the Catskill Community Center, with M.A. Tarpinian, Dharma Dailey, Tom Roe, and others; and from Germantown Community Farm with Kaya Weidman and others.
 </p><p>
 In September 2009, WGXC received a commitment of $71,485 from the US Department of Commerce. This award secured 50 percent of the funding needed for the equipment (transmitter, antenna, etc.) to launch WGXC’s FM signal. On December 31, 2009, WGXC launched its capital-campaign with a New Year''s Eve celebration that featured 60 local performers, and by September 2010, succeeded in raising matching funds.
 </p><p>
  In September 2010, WGXC partnered with the national radio advocacy organization <a href="http://www.prometheusradio.org/" target="_blank">Prometheus Radio Project</a> to host its first full-power FM barnraising in Hudson. The conference included three days of hands-on workshops, presentations, and performances, during which participants collaborated to build WGXC’s Hudson studio and help prepare the station for its FM signal launch. 
  </p><p>
  In December 2010, WGXC programmers began broadcasting live shows on WGXC’s webstream from the Hudson studio.
 </p><p>
  On February 26, 2011, WGXC went live on air at 90.7 FM. WGXC celebrated this momentous occasion with a live broadcast event at the <a href="http://www.catskillcommunitycenter.org/" target="_blank">Catskill Community Center</a>, which featured many of the station’s first on-air programmers. The WGXC Catskill studio began broadcasting in September 2011. 
  </p><p>
WGXC currently broadcasts out of three studios located in Hudson, Acra, and Catskill, NY.
