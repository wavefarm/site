   <h2>WGXC VOLUNTEER PROGRAMMERS</h2>
  <p>
An extraordinarily diverse group volunteer programmers are behind the over 100 shows that air regularly on WGXC 90.7-FM. Information about each show including descriptions and host biographies are available by clicking the name of the show either from a broadcast page or from the alphabetical list, which appears <a href="https://wavefarm.org/archive?q=type%3Ashow%20_exists_%3Aairtime%20sites%3Awgxc&date=&date2=&size=120&sort=sort">HERE</a>. Information about becoming a WGXC Volunteer Programmer is available <a href="https://wavefarm.org/wgxc/volunteer">HERE</a>.  </p>
  <h2>WGXC COMMUNITY ADVISORY COUNCIL</h2>
  <p>
The WGXC Community Advisory Council is comprised of volunteers that serve on the various WGXC Volunteer Advisory Committees. Members of the Community Advisory Council support station management by offering a representative voice of the community and active participation on at least one and no more than two of the Volunteer Advisory Committees of Fundraising, Outreach, Programming, and Policy. The collective body of these committees is known as the WGXC Community Advisory Council. The Advisory Council serves solely at the pleasure of management; therefore, the Council, and its constituent committees, are not committees of the Board or committees of the corporation. Full descriptions of each committee, as well as their regular meeting schedules can be found <a href="/wgxc/volunteer#committees">here</a></a>.</p><p>

  <h2>STATION HISTORY</h2>
  <p>
  Wave Farm (aka free103point9 Inc.) submitted an application to the FCC in October 2007 during a rare filing window for full-power non-commercial educational FM radio stations. A year later, on October 17, 2008, free103point9 received a construction permit to build a new FM station. The FM station was planned to serve both sides of the organization's roots: radio art and community access on the airwaves.
  </p><p>
  In June 2008, an Advisory Council was established to guide the development of the station with regards to serving Greene and Columbia counties’ local community. Council members provided critical input in naming the station, establishing the program schedule, and getting 90.7-FM off the ground and on the airwaves. 
  </p><p>
  WGXC Online Radio began streaming at wgxc.org on May 9, 2009, live from the Catskill Community Center, with M.A. Tarpinian, Dharma Dailey, Tom Roe, and others; and from Germantown Community Farm with Kaya Weidman and others.
 </p><p>
 In September 2009, WGXC received a commitment of $71,485 from the US Department of Commerce. This award secured 50 percent of the funding needed for the intial equipment (transmitter, antenna, etc.) to launch WGXC’s FM signal. On December 31, 2009, WGXC furthered its capital-campaign with a New Year's Eve celebration that featured 60 local performers, and by September 2010, succeeded in raising matching funds.
 </p><p>
  In September 2010, WGXC partnered with the national radio advocacy organization <a href="http://www.prometheusradio.org/" target="_blank">Prometheus Radio Project</a> to host a first full-power FM barnraising in Hudson. The conference included three days of hands-on workshops, presentations, and performances, during which participants collaborated to build WGXC’s Hudson studio and help prepare the station for its FM signal launch. 
  </p><p>
  In December 2010, WGXC programmers began broadcasting live shows on WGXC’s webstream from the Hudson studio.
 </p><p>
  On February 26, 2011, WGXC went live on air at 90.7 FM. WGXC celebrated this momentous occasion with a live broadcast event at the <a href="http://www.catskillcommunitycenter.org/" target="_blank">Catskill Community Center</a>, which featured many of the station’s first on-air programmers.
  </p><p>
WGXC currently broadcasts out of two full-time studios located in Hudson and Acra, NY. WGXC's Satellite studio is located within the Catskill Public Library. This mobile broadcasting unit facilitates live remote broadcasts throughout the station's listening area.
