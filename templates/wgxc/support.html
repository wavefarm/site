  <h1>SUPPORT</h1>
<p>
Financial support through donations, underwriting, and merchandise sales, allows Wave Farm to meet the most basic WGXC operating costs, and keeps creative community radio on your FM dial!</a>

WGXC is a program division of the 501(c)3 non-profit arts organization Wave Farm, and your contributions are tax-deductible to the full extent of the law.</p>

<h2>DONATE ONLINE</h2>
<p>Make a one-time donation or become a monthly sustaining supporter by using the buttons to the left.</p>

<h2>DONATE BY CHECK</h2>
<p>Checks should be made payable to: WGXC<br />
Mail to: 5662 Route 23, Acra, NY 12405.</p>


<h2>STOCK / SECURITIES DONATION</h2>
<p>WGXC is now able to accept donations of stock.<br /><br />
With a charitable gift of appreciated shares held long-term, the donation you make and the deduction you get are greater than they would be if you were to instead sell the shares and donate the cash proceeds. This is because when you donate shares, you avoid paying the capital gains tax.
For more information about making this type of donation to Wave Farm’s WGXC, please contact Galen Joseph-Hunter galen [at] wavefarm.org or (518) 622-2598.</p>

<h2>DONATED GOODS / EQUIPMENT</h2>
<p>WGXC gratefully accepts donated goods and equipment that is of use for the station. Contact info@wgxc.org or (518) 697-7400 for more information. WGXC is currently in need of:
  <li>Donated Records and CDs to be resold at the WGXC Record & Media Fair  </li>

<h1><a id="underwriting"></a> WGXC UNDERWRITING</h1>

<p>
Why underwrite with WGXC? Underwriting is a unique opportunity to reach WGXC’s 78,000 potential listeners on 90.7-FM, and thousands more who regularly visit wgxc.org. WGXC’s listeners believe in the importance of local media, and support the local businesses and organizations that support us. Our listeners are engaged and informed consumers. They value and recognize the investment made by local and regional businesses and organizations in support of community media.
</p><p>
What is underwriting? Underwriting is a specialized and non-commercial form of advertising. These on-air announcements are broadcast at the top of every hour, 24 hours a day. The content and broadcast schedule of these announcements must comply with FCC regulations, and are drafted cooperatively by WGXC and each underwriter.
