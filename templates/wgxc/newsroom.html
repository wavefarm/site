<a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/66208818746/" title="Windham-based commerical radio station.">WRIP</a> | The Wave Farm Residency Program provides artists with a unique opportunity to concentrate on new transmission art works, conduct research, and present work on a full­power FM radio station. During 2016, this dynamic and innovative incubator for the creation of new art work will include ten residencies selected from a competitive international open call. Residents receive a $750 artist fee. Pending funding, travel stipends will also be awarded. In 2015, thanks to increased NEA support, artist fees were increased to $700 (up from $500 the prior year). Our efforts to increase financial support to artists runs parallel to the exciting and exponential growth the program has experienced over the past four years. Located in the northern foothills of the Catskill Mountain Park, 120 miles north of New York City, Wave Farm is situated on 30 retreat­like acres with meadows, ponds, mountain views, and forested walking paths. Wave Farm is located in the rural town of Cairo in Greene County, New York, 18 miles from Hudson, and 44 miles from Albany. The Wave Farm Study Center serves as the facility for the Residency Program. The Study Center includes ADA compliant accommodations and workspace for residents, a unique library of materials specific to the transmission art genre, and a broadcast studio for Wave Farm’s WGXC 90.7FM. The Study Center reading, viewing, and listening library contains hundreds of critical texts and transmission works. This growing collection of reference materials includes books, journals, articles, manuals, and audio and video files specific to transmission arts, radio, video, performance, sound, media theory, earthworks, and contemporary art practice. Wave Farm’s organizational archive, which documents activities since 1997, also includes artists­in­residence projects. A 2014 facilities grant from the New York State Council on the Arts enabled significant and specialized technical upgrades including a new broadcast console, site­specific AM radio transmitter, electrical and audio inputs as well as WiFi access across the property. In addition, Wave Farm’s equipment inventory includes an array of audio and video transmitters, receivers, recording and postproduction equipment. Technical support is provided by Artistic Director, Tom Roe, with additional support from Executive Director, Galen Joseph­Hunter, who assists artists with administrative matters including writing, grant research, and outreach to the field. The Wave Farm Residency program provides a unique vehicle for the presentation of work. Resident artists are interviewed, perform, and present work on Wave Farm's non­commercial radio station, WGXC 90.7­FM. Resident artists are also given the opportunity to conduct workshops for public audiences in an intimate hands­on setting. Additionally, selected artists are able to utilize the Wave Farm property to research and develop longterm outdoor installations, as well as install works in the Study Center gallery space.
