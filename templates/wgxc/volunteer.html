<h1><a id="programmer"></a>Programmer Basics</h1>
    <h2><a id="volunteer"></a>Volunteer Requirements</h2>
    <p>Programmers are expected to participate in the organization and maintain an active status as a volunteer, completing at least six hours of volunteer service each year. The time a programmer spends on air or otherwise producing their show does not count toward this requirement. Volunteer time can be completed in a variety of ways to benefit the station. Common volunteer opportunities include, but are not limited to: Participation in one of the various clerical, library, or housekeeping tasks within the station; additional participation in on-air pledge drives; and/or training and skill-sharing with other programmers. 
</p><p>
*Syndicated programs not produced at a WGXC studio are exempt from this requirement.

</p>

    <h2><a id="listserve"></a>Listserv</h2>
<p>
WGXC currently maintains an e-mail listserv for use by eligible programmers. Programmers become eligible for list membership after the completion of basic on-air training. Use of the list is optional. The list is a tool for communication, providing a venue to post questions and ideas and to share information and resources. It is administered by WGXC staff. 
</p><p>
Forwards, other spam-like email, or messages unrelated to WGXC business are not permitted. If a post is found to be inappropriate for the forum, staff will contact the user directly. Consistent and ongoing abuse of the listserv rules will lead to the loss of list privileges. 
</p><p>
Examples of appropriate use of the list:<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Communication between programmers about upcoming on-air guests, topics and interviews. <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharing of information about WGXC-related events. <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recruiting fill-in hosts during hiatus or vacations. 
</p>
    <h2><a id="music"></a>Music Reporting</h2>
    <p>For a two-week period every three months, programmers must provide a detailed and comprehensive report of the music played on 90.7 FM for music licensing purposes. Instructions and basic training provided to each programmer. Programmers are informed in advance of when a comprehensive music-reporting period is in effect. </p>
    <h2><a id="pledge"></a>Pledge Drives</h2>
    <p>
    WGXC holds a minimum of two, 10-day, on-air pledge drives per year. This is how the organization raises the bulk of its operating expenses. Programmers are required to participate in the on-air fundraising effort during their regular show time. 
    </p><p>
Programmers must be prepared to fundraise for a minimum of half of the show’s length. While the time spent on air does not count as volunteer time, discussed in this handbook’s Volunteer section, if it is a part of a programmer’s regularly scheduled broadcast, pledge drives provide the opportunity for programmers to help out in other ways as well. 
    </p><p>
Volunteering at other times during the pledge drive — to pitch on the air, answer phones, etc. — is expected. Programmers are also asked to make an effort to identify people to call in and pledge during their show. In the weeks leading up to pledge drives, trainings are held to prepare programmers for on-air fundraising. 
    </p><p>
During each pledge drive, volunteers — including WGXC staff and Council — will step forward to assist programmers with pitching on air, handling phones, and coordinating other volunteers. 
    </p><p>
Pledging during syndicated programming on WGXC: producers of syndicated programming airing on WGXC are encouraged to produce PSAs or include a mention of WGXC’s Pledge Drive in programs airing during Pledge Drives.

    </p>
  
    </p>
    <h2><a id="terms"></a>Program Terms</h2>
    <p>All programmers are given a term of one year. All programmers, in good-standing, are invited to participate in a simple reapplication process at the end of their term in order to continue as an active program for an additional term. Programmers in good standing have completed their required annual volunteer hours, have not incurred more than three warning points, or otherwise violated the policies in this document. </p>
    <h2><a id="security"></a>Security & Equipment</h2>
    <p>
    The programmer is integral to maintaining the security of WGXC’s equipment and spaces. Programmers may ask visitors to identify themselves and to disclose the reasons for being in the studio. Programmers may also ask a visitor to leave if they have no legitimate reason for being there. Programmers are expected to be courteous to one another and to staff. Staff or volunteers on site should be advised when programmers arrive and leave the station. 
</p><p>
It is very important to leave the studio in suitable shape for the programmers that follow you, and the station must be left secure. There is a shutdown checklist posted in each studio, which involves a variety of tasks, from common-sense tidiness to station security. Failure to follow these procedures could constitute, at best, a nuisance for other programmers and, at worst, a major security or property damage risk for the station. 
</p><p>
Whether you are prerecording or doing a live show, we ask that you leave the studio tidy and the equipment ready for the next program/programmer by doing the following. 
</p><p>

    <h2><a id="social"></a>Promote Your Show</h2>
    
    <p>
WGXC'S WEBSITE: Instructions for how to add information to WGXC's Website, coming soon!    
    </p>
    <p>
SOCIAL MEDIA: WGXC is on Facebook and Twitter, and programmers are encouraged to help build audiences for WGXC's presence on both of these platforms. In addition, some programmers have made “Pages” on Facebook or twitter accounts for their program. This can be a great way to build a base of online followers for your show, to remind them when you’re on the air, and to share your archives. Do not name your page “WGXC,” use your show name. 
</p><p>
Before you go on the air, send a tweet to WGXC’s followers both on WGXC's Twitter account and your own if you have one. 
<p>
How to access WGXC's Twitter account: Before going on the air, go to one of the WGXC linux computers and open an internet browser, by clicking the blue globe icon on the bottom of the computer screen. Click on the bookmark called “WGXC Twitter”. (If you’re not live at the studio, you can also go to twitter.com) Check with a staff member for login information. On the left side of the page, click on the tab that says, “Compose new Tweet…”. Now, type a short message about your show that’s about to air, with a maximum 140 characters. Use a respectful tone, and include necessary information 
</p><p>
Example: Tune in for “The Ag Show” at 2 p.m. with the editors of @ModFarm. You can call in with questions at 518-828-0290. wgxc.org 
</p><p>
ON-AIR PROMOS: Have you heard those, short announcements on the air about some of our programs? We want everyone to record a promo for their show. If you haven’t done this yet, get in touch with our Program Director and we’ll help you make one. You can also record special promos for exciting upcoming programs: Are you interviewing a mayor? Is your next show a call-in show? You can record a short promo for broadcast in the days leading up to your show. 
</p><p>
WEBPAGE: Lots of programmers have made their own websites for their shows. They post playlists of past shows, post their archives, and let people know what’s coming up. If you want to make a free and user-friendly personal website, you might try: tumblr.com, blogspot.com, and wordpress.com. 
</p><p>
Some other ways to spread the word 
</p><p>
1. Send a big email out to all of your friends and family the day before your show - remind them of when they can tune in, where they can find the archive. <br />
2. If you’re a Facebook user, post a status on facebook before you go on the air – or post a comment on the wall of WGXC’s Facebook page, and let all of our followers know. <br />
3. Make posters or handbills about your show, and put them up around town! <br />
4. Good old-fashioned word of mouth: don’t ever stop talking about what you’re doing.
    </p>
    <h2><a id="traing"></a>Training</h2>
    <p>Programmers need no previous knowledge or training in radio broadcasting or production to have a show on WGXC. The station provides training for all new programmers in a variety of skills and techniques including live broadcast engineering, interview techniques, audio recording, editing, preproduction and field recording. All WGXC Programmers will also receive WGXC-specific training, including FCC compliance. </p>

<h1><a id="on-air"></a>On-Air Conduct & Board Operating</h1>
<h2><a id="ids"></a>Station IDs, PSAs, Underwriting</h2>
<p>It is essential that there be a trained board operator in the studio for all live programs. If you are a programmer and aren’t comfortable operating the board, WGXC will provide a board operator to help you until you can do it yourself. Ultimately, board operators are responsible for everything that happens in the studio and on the air. 
</p><p>
A board operator/programmer is responsible for the following: <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A legal station identification at the top of every hour during the broadcast. <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  One public service announcement at the start of the show. <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  One underwriting announcement at the start of the show. (*or on Saturdays and late nights, one funder acknowledgement announcement.) <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Five minutes of events from the WGXC Events Calendar. These readings can be spread throughout the show. This is required of all music shows, except the shows in the noon timeslot on Monday through Friday. Those programmers must play the noon headlines instead. <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Breaking news bulletins from the Managing News Editor such as weather bulletins, road closings, etc. when they are posted. <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  All on-air conduct and material broadcast during the show, including that of the guests. <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The security of WGXC music and equipment. 
</p><p>
<strong>Station Identification </strong>
</p><p>
The FCC requires the station identify itself every hour, on the hour. This is called a legal station ID. To be legal, the station ID must be: “WGXC, ACRA” 
</p><p>
The legal ID must be stated wholly and completely at the beginning of every hour. We cannot insert any words or phrases into the statement listed above. We may say whatever we please before or after the legal ID, but the ID itself must air in this format. To make station IDs more interesting, they can be made as jingles or surrounded by short radio dramas, statements about programming content, or celebrity endorsements. Only the legal ID is regulated by the FCC; programmers are encouraged to identify the station any way they please throughout the remainder of the hour. 
</p><p>
<strong>Public Service Announcements (PSAs) </strong>
</p><p>
Informing listeners of events occurring in our community is one of the valuable services the station provides. Programmers are required to play or read at least one public service announcement per hour. The required PSA should be played at the beginning of the hour. 
</p><p>
<strong>Underwriting Announcements </strong>
</p><p>
WGXC is a noncommercial station, and the FCC prohibits noncommercial stations from broadcasting advertisements of any kind. However, we are allowed to air underwriting announcements, which allow us to acknowledge the support of the business community. Underwriting is also a community service, as well as an important income stream for WGXC. Programmers are required to play underwriting announcements. 
</p>


<h2><a id="conduct"></a>On Air Conduct in Seven Parts (FCC)</h2>
<p>
<strong>Part One: Promotional and Commercial Speech </strong>
</p><p>
As the holder of a non-commercial FCC broadcast license, WGXC must take great care not to provide direct promotions for business; This constitutes advertising and is prohibited by law. The announcement of local events that occur in our listening area is encouraged. We see this as a public service to our listeners, but great care must be taken to avoid crossing the line between public service and advertising. This section outlines our policies in this area. 
</p><p>
Prices: Announcements containing price information are not permissible. This would include any announcement of interest rate information or other indication of savings or value associated with product or business. 
</p><p>
Examples: Ten dollars at the door for the benefit concert on Friday. (Instead of mentioning the price, you can point listeners toward the link on the WGXC Events page for more information.) They are the cheapest (product or service) around. 
</p><p>
Inducements: Announcements containing an inducement to buy, sell, rent, or lease, are not permissible. 
</p><p>
Examples: Movie admission free to museum members. Vivian's Chocolate Valentine chocolate for the first 50 people through the doors. Six months of free service if you sign up for locally provided internet now. 
</p><p>
Calls to Action: Announcements containing a call to action are not permissible. The FCC disallows calls to action on public broadcasting stations. A Call to Action is a statement or phrase that commands or invites someone to action. The best way to explain this is to give some examples. 
</p><p>
Example: "Bring lawn chairs and blankets." The word "bring" is a call to action, you are telling a listener to "bring" something with them. The compliant manner of stating this would be "Lawn chairs and blankets welcomed." You are not telling the listener to do something; you are merely stating that the events organizers will allow people to have these items with them at the event. 
</p><p>
Example: "Come to tonight's presentation of Such and Such." In this statement you are telling the listener to take action by coming to the event. The compliant version of this statement would be "The Such and Such organization will present Such and Such tonight." This simply says that the event is tonight and does not instruct a listener to be there. 
</p><p>
Example: "Don't forget to get your tickets." "Don't forget" and "get" are both instructions to the listener to take action, in this case, get tickets. To be compliant you would say "Tickets available by pre-order only." You can see that it is the same message, which is to get your tickets ahead of time, but the language falls within the parameters of what the FCC and WLRH does permit. 
</p><p>
Example: “For more information call 555-1234." The word "call" is clearly an inducement for a listener to take action, in this case to pick up their phone and "call." The same message is communicated by changing the language to "Information at 555-1234." 
</p><p>
In the past the phrase "We invite you…" was not allowable. It is still considered a gray area. In our situation, where local representatives are used for voicing their organizations PSA it is allowable, by local policy, as long as it is low key in nature. 
</p><p>
As programmer, you may not issue a call to action by asking or suggesting that the listeners should perform some task which may result in an organization other than WGXC making money. You may state that a new CD by "MC Whoever" is available at "The Little CD Store" but you cannot tell listeners to go there and "buy it on sale now for $12.99." For announcements of events, ticket prices cannot be mentioned, but a phone number or website should be provided where listeners can get that information. 
</p><p>
Value neutral descriptions: You cannot qualify a product, service or event as something that may be more or better in some way than another event, service or product. The FCC disallows public broadcast outlets from comparative language in describing products, services, or events. Commercial broadcasters can say that something is the best, or number one, or one of kind, but we cannot. We can't even use language that will suggest that. 
</p><p>
When describing something in value neutral terms you will be describing the actual event, product or service exactly as it is without embellishing language. Here's an example of what is allowable: 
</p><p>
"The Such and Such organization will present their annual spring concert this Saturday at 6 p.m., and will feature the music of Grammy winning artist, So and So. Lawn chairs, coolers and blankets will keep you comfortable under the night sky. Information at 555-1234." Here's an example of the same one that is not allowable: 
</p><p>
"The Such and Such organization, one of the leading organizations of it's kind, will present their fantastic annual spring concert this Saturday at 6 p.m., featuring the country's favorite artist, Grammy winning So and So. Lawn chairs, coolers and blankets will keep you comfortable under the night sky. Information at 555-1234." 
</p><p>
The underlined portions of this example are, without question, not compliant with rules regarding value neutral descriptions. 
</p><p>
Promoting local organization fundraisers: At no time will WGXC promote an organizations' fundraiser unless it can be promoted strictly as an event. A concert to raise money for a service organization can be promoted as a concert with a brief statement in the body of the announcement that states who will benefit. An example is: " …Proceeds benefit Such and Such organization." 
</p><p>
This is the only statement allowable in a PSA to acknowledge a beneficiary. Words such as "fundraiser" are not allowable. There are some fundraising activities that we simply cannot promote, no matter how worthy the cause because the language cannot be modified. Examples include silent auctions and yard sales. WGXC does not permit mentions of an organization’s event sponsors in PSAs. 
</p><p>
Tone of PSAs: The tone you use when reading PSAs is important. PSAs must sound consistent with our other announcements. PSAs that are read like a commercial, even with compliant language and content, is inconsistent with our overall presentation and will be pulled from our rotation 
</p><p>
Additional language/content guideline: All PSAs must end with "Information at…" This creates a "consistency of sound," an important component of WGXC's overall sound. Do not qualify the word "information" with words like "further" or "more." A website or email address is also acceptable with or without a phone number, but may not include added language. 
</p><p>
Many of WGXC's programmers cover topics in their shows that they specialize in professionally. This can add a valuable perspective to the discussions that they air, but programmers or their guests may never engage in promotion of their own business ventures on the air. It is implicit in our mission that no individual, business, or organization should profit directly from the use of these public airwaves. A programmer or guest's professional qualifications or business affiliations may be referred to during a show where appropriate, for credentialing purposes only. In keeping with our goal to maintain a barrier between professional gain and the use of our airwaves, we also ask programmers to follow these additional guidelines: 
</p><p>
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Use references to your professional accreditation or credentials as credential. <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Use contact information for your program that is NOT the same as your business contact information (this includes websites). <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  When providing contact information for a guest that is the same as their business contact information, refrain from repeating it too often. Contact information should be announced at a predictable time during your broadcast, preferably at the end. <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Disclose any affiliation that might affect or have the appearance of affecting your coverage of a topic, organization, or event. <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  When appropriate, identify your opinions as your own and your guests as their own and not those of WGXC and/or Wave Farm. <br />
</p><p>
If you have a band and you have a gig, are an author and have book release, etc., put it on the Events Calendar on the website, post it to the on-air e-mail listserv and let your fellow programmers know you are available to go on their shows. You can also leave a copy of your CD or book at the Hudson studio, to be reviewed/played by other programmers. Don't ever just go on the air to promote yourself. 
</p><p>
Compensation in the form of either PAYOLA or PLUGOLA is illegal. 
</p><p>
Payola refers to receiving any kind of consideration to play someone's music or feature a product or guest. 
</p><p>
Plugola refers to the on-air promotion of goods or services in which the programmer has a financial interest. The standard situation is where the programmer promotes a club, music store, or concert in which they have an undisclosed personal interest. 
</p><p>
Do not accept money, services, goods, or other valuable consideration from anyone (individuals, organizations, associates or other entities) to broadcast anything and don't promote any activity or matter in which you have a direct or indirect financial interest. 
</p><p>
<strong>Part Two: Obscenity, Indecency, and Profanity </strong>
</p><p>
Although the First Amendment provides broad protections from government regulation of speech, broadcasters do not enjoy the same expressive rights as individual citizens. This is because broadcasters are trustees of the public airwaves (a limited resource) and the act of broadcasting itself is “pervasive” – radio waves are everywhere, and thus the likelihood of inadvertent exposure to objectionable speech is considered serious enough to regulate. 
</p><p>
The Federal Communications Commission prohibits or restricts three forms of speech in particular: obscenity, indecency, and profanity. 
</p><p>
Obscenity has been defined by the United States Supreme Court to be hyper-sexualized material that is “patently offensive” by “contemporary community standards” and most importantly, “lack[s] serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.” Obscene material may also be indecent and/or profane, but it must meet these three specific criteria. Obscenity is not allowed on the public airwaves at any time. 
</p><p>
Indecency is defined by the FCC as content that “depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive to contemporary community standards…sexual or excretory organs or activities.” If this sounds similar to obscenity, you’re right – except that indecent material does have some redeeming social value. The FCC only allows the broadcast of indecent material between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. (these are called “Safe Harbor” hours). 
</p><p>
Profanity is defined by the FCC as “language so grossly offensive to members of the public who actually hear it as to amount to a nuisance.” In simple terms, profanity involves the use of expletives and grossly offensive pejorative speech. Like indecency, profanity may only be broadcast between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. 
</p><p>
The FCC’s enforcement process regarding indecency and profanity is complaint-driven, and those who complain have to provide documentation – including information relating to the details of the broadcast, the date and time it occurred, and station information. The FCC will ask for a response from the station, examines the context of the complaint, and then determines if a monetary penalty is warranted. Fines for indecency can range from the thousands to millions of dollars, but the majority fall within the $1,000 - $100,000 range. 
</p><p>
In recent years, the FCC’s regulation of objectionable speech has come under significant legal review, and there are now open questions about the continuing viability of such regulation in the context of our modern media environment. But the current definitions and regulations stand and will continue to be enforced until these questions are resolved. 
</p><p>
In a nutshell: keep your programming clean if you broadcast outside the Safe Harbor hours, which constitute the majority of the broadcast day. During Safe Harbor, it may be a good idea to warn that some of your programming may be unsuitable to sensitive listeners if any of it may be considered indecent or profane. If you have specific questions about profanity, indecency, or obscenity, please contact WGXC’s Program Director or Station Manager. 
</p><p>

</p><p>
<strong>Part Three: Hate Speech and Sensitivity </strong>
</p><p>
WGXC takes seriously its mission to promote access to the airwaves for under-represented voices as well as its responsibilities as a community organization. Speech that is intended to or has the effect of hurting or intimidating any individual or group of people, or incites violence, is considered hate speech. Broadcasting hate speech undermines the mission of our station and compromises our community's trust in us. Don't do it. 
</p><p>
Beyond the issue of hate there are larger issues of sensitivity. We ask that you make it your business to be sensitive to different listeners in our community. It is not uncommon in the United States for underrepresented and/or marginalized groups of people to be portrayed unfairly in the media. What you may consider funny or idiosyncratic about a group of people is often not funny and even offensive to that group. Put yourself in the shoes of others and behave accordingly. 
</p><p>
<strong>Part Four: Equal Access for Political Candidates</strong> 
</p><p>
Coverage of political elections, particularly local ones, is a valuable service a community radio station can perform for listeners. While it is not in the interest of this station to limit discussion of any topic or access to any guest, there are certain implications for the station as it pertains to political candidates. Here is what the FCC has to say about it: When a qualified candidate for public office has been permitted to use a station, the Communications Act requires the station to "afford equal opportunities to all other such candidates for that office." The Act also states that the station "shall have no power of censorship over the material broadcast" by the candidate. 
</p><p>
We do not consider either of the following two categories as a "use" that is covered by this rule: An appearance by a legally qualified candidate on a bona fide newscast, interview or documentary (if the appearance of the candidate is incidental to the presentation of the subject covered by the documentary); or on-the-spot coverage of a bona fide news event (including political conventions and related incidental activities). 
</p><p>
What this means is that if you invite a qualified candidate for political office onto your show, even if only to discuss fishing or worm composting, the station is required to provide equal time to any and all opposing candidates for the same office, if they so request. The Programming Director and Station Manager will facilitate all such requests. You may be required to yield some of your airtime to make this possible. 
</p><p>
Regular programmers that are elected officials or running for office must observe a three-month hiatus prior to any Primary or General Election. 
</p><p>
Part Five: Opinion, Slander & Disturbing Content 
</p><p>
When expressing your opinion, please make it known that you are speaking for yourself and not WGXC or Wave Farm. 
</p><p>
Do not slander. Slander is defined as making a false, malicious, or defamatory statement against an individual or group. Ultimately, you are legally liable for any on-air statements you make. 
</p><p>
At any time, if you decide to air content that may be inappropriate for children or may otherwise be disturbing, please warn listeners in advance of and periodically throughout your broadcast so that they have the opportunity to avoid that content. 
</p><p>
<strong>Part Six: Co-hosts, Guests & Phone Calls</strong> 
</p><p>
It is not uncommon for programmers to want to share their airtime, either regularly or irregularly, with a co-host. Multiple hosts can create a more dynamic and compelling program. However, please be aware that co-hosts may not operate any studio equipment other than a microphone or telephone (for call screening, etc.), unless the co-host is also a fully-trained programmer at WGXC. The show’s programmer of record, is ultimately responsible for everyone’s on-air conduct. 
</p><p>
Programmers may invite any individual(s) they desire to be guests on their shows. All guests and their behavior are the responsibility of the programmer who invited them. Any WGXC policy and FCC regulation infringements committed by a guest are ultimately the responsibility of the programmer, and any warning points that may result will be directed at the programmer. 
</p><p>
Choose your guests wisely, and prepare them on how they should conduct themselves on the air. Make every effort to inform guests, prior to broadcast, of exactly what kinds of speech they may not engage in. If a guest violates policy or is uncooperative, the programmer has every right to restrict the guest's access to the air. This also applies to any guest you may have live over the telephone. To allow any guest to violate FCC speech regulations (obscenity, indecency, profanity) puts not only your own show but the station’s license at risk. 
</p><p>
FCC rules regarding telephone conversations require that we inform all callers that their conversations will be broadcast. This applies to both live and recorded programming that uses telephone conversations. Airing a person’s comments over the phone, live or recorded, without their consent can result in FCC sanctions that may jeopardize WGXC’s license. 
</p><p>
<strong>Part Seven: Aliases, Anonymity & Credits</strong> 
</p><p>
All programmers should identify who produces their show in some way during their show — for most programmers, that is you. When discussing strong opinions or airing content that may be controversial, please remind WGXC's listeners that the views and opinions expressed are not those of the station or Wave Farm. Hosts do have a right to use an alias on the air, and are required to disclose when a guest is using an alias on the air. However, you must properly identify yourself on all program and broadcast logs. 
</p>
<h2><a id="facility"></a>Facility Use</h2>
<p>
Studio Use Priorities 
</p><p>
There are many different functions occurring in WGXC’s broadcast studios at any given time: live broadcasts, prerecording, training, etc. A priority system for studio use clarifies and streamlines scheduling needs. These priorities are as follows: <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Priority 1: Regularly scheduled live programs <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Priority 2: Prerecording/production of regularly scheduled programs <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Priority 3: Training (formal training and one-on-one sessions) <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Priority 4: Technical maintenance <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Priority 5: Fill-in programming. 
</p><p>
Reserving a Studio
</p><p>
A studio-use schedule is posted in each studio. Staff members must approve scheduling requests initiated by programmers. The broadcast schedule can be found on wgxc.org by clicking on the “Schedule” link. 
</p><p>
Equipment Training
</p><p>
No WGXC equipment may be used or borrowed without proper training. Requests for training should be directed to WGXC staff. Please refer to the WGXC Equipment Policy for additional information. 
</p><p>
Studio Access
</p><p>
Please note: programmers and volunteers are prohibited from sleeping overnight in WGXC studio facilities (With the exception of Wave Farm artists-in-residence in Acra). If the actions or behavior of a person at a studio is deemed inappropriate by a WGXC staff member, s/he will be asked to leave. 
</p><p>
Hudson Studio Access
</p><p>
Hudson Studio access at times outside regular business hours (10 a.m. to 6 p.m.) shall be granted to programmers and volunteers only with the approval of either the Program Director (for programmers), Outreach Coordinator (for volunteers) and the Station Manager. The Station Manager shall keep a log of all individuals who have access to the studio outside of business hours, noting the date access was given, and the staff members who approved access. 
</p><p>
Catskill Studio Access
</p><p>
Coming soon. 
</p><p>
Acra Studio Access
</p><p>
Coming soon.
</p><p>
Office Use
</p><p>
Programmers can use reception area computers, telephones, etc. for WGXC-related business only. All other activities should be cleared with a member of WGXC staff. Other station-related business may take priority over programmers' use of the reception-area computers. Equipment labeled as "Youth Priority" may be used by all programmers, but is reserved for WGXC's youth programmers upon request. Please refer to the WGXC Computer and Email Policy for additional guidelines in these areas. 
</p><p>
General Tidiness
</p><p>
It is the shared responsibility of WGXC staff, programmers, and volunteers to assist in keeping station facilities tidy. As a general rule one should leave the space cleaner than when it was entered. 
</p><p>
No food or drinks are ever allowed in WGXC’s broadcast studios. 
</p><p>
Program Transitions
</p><p>
When transitioning between shows in a studio, programmers must leave the studio promptly and with all of their program materials so that the next programmer can begin their program with focus and a clean slate. Many programmers make arrangements with the programmer on the air before them that allows for some studio-overlap. These arrangements should be made between programmers a case-by-case basis; please keep in mind that not all programmers are able to function comfortably with others in the studio. 
</p>


<h2><a id="points"></a>Policy Enforcement / Warning Point System</h2>
<p>
From time to time the Station Manager may observe or is notified that a programmer has violated station policy. When this happens, the Station Manager reviews the concern with the programmer(s) in question. If the Station Manager determines that a violation has occurred, a warning point system is used to enforce key policies and procedures. 
</p><p>
1. One-Point Violations: 
</p><p>
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Lights left on <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Failing to meet the Station ID / PSA / Underwriting requirement<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Not cleaning up after yourself <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Running over into another program’s time slot 
</p><p>
2. Two-Point Violations: 
</p><p>
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Food and/or drink in studio <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Missing a program without making proper plans for your absence (you need to inform the station 48 hours in advance of any absence) <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Removing music from the station 
</p><p>
3. Three-Point Violations:
</p><p>
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Profanity (except during Safe Harbor hours 10 p.m. - 6 a.m.) <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Indecency/obscenity on air <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Commercial speech on air <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Failing to lock a door <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Failing to set alarm <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Unauthorized removal of equipment from the station <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Operating the board while intoxicated or otherwise “under the influence” 
</p><p>
Programmers will be made aware of any warning points they receive due to a policy violation.
</p><p>
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  three warning points: a written warning to the programmer <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  five points: the programmer will receive a warning and a suspension of on-air clearance for one show <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  nine points: on-air clearance is suspended for the duration of the term as well as for the following term. 
</p><p>
Points remain on record for twelve months from the date of the policy violation. After twelve months the corresponding points expire. Should a programmer feel that they have been unfairly found in violation of station policy, they have the right to appeal the decision. Programmers are also entitled to use the WGXC grievance process in addition to appealing points decisions. 
</p><p>
WGXC’s goal in using this system is to correct problems as they arise and get folks back on track as quickly as possible – not to remove programmers from the air. However, we must also take seriously any failure to comply with station policy. Should you observe any of the behavior listed above, please report it to feedback@wgxc.org for review by the Station Manager. Self-reporting and on-air corrections are encouraged as well and usually results in a reduction in the number of points awarded for a policy violation. 
</p>
<h2><a id="feedback"></a>Evaluation & Feedback</h2>
<p>
WGXC’s listeners are invited and encouraged to send feedback regarding the station’s programming to <a href="mailto:feedback@wgxc.org">feedback [at] wgxc.org</a>. 
</p><p>
WGXC’s Station Manager will review the feedback account on a daily basis. Messages for programmers will be forwarded promptly to those individuals. Messages for staff members will be forwarded promptly to those individuals. General comments and complaints from the listening public will be responded to within two weeks of the initial contact. Any feedback submitted by programmers, volunteers, or staff that is determined to be a dispute or complaint will be flagged and the sender will be directed towards WGXC’s Dispute and Complaint Resolution policy. 
</p><p>
The Station Manager will prepare periodic feedback reports to the staff, Community Council, and Wave Farm's Executive Director. Feedback reports are intended to aggregate all feedback WGXC receives — praises, criticisms, concerns and questions.

WGXC Logo and Footer 
</p><p>
To unify materials produced on behalf of WGXC, while ensuring autonomy for the artists creating WGXC special event promotional fliers, posters, etc., a WGXC footer has been designed and is required on all materials that represent programs and activities produced by WGXC. 
</p><p>
The WGXC logo and footer is available for download <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zgown7qps4lskvd/FhWNASm2B8" targer="_blank">here</a>. 
</p><p>
Official Name & Language 
</p><p>
The official name for WGXC is “WGXC: Hands-on Radio” <br />
The official Station ID is “WGXC, Acra”<br />
The official tagline is “Creative Community Radio”<br />
</p><p>
Approval Process 
</p><p>
Each use of the WGXC logo and all promotional materials must be authorized by a member of the WGXC Design Committee. PDF proofs must be sent to design [at] wgxc.org for review. The design committee needs at least three business days to approve all usage requests. 
</p><p>
Any financial expenditure requests must be approved by the Station Manager. 
</p>
<h2><a id="fundraising"></a>Fundraising & Outreach</h2>
<p>
WGXC is a Program Division of Wave Farm, a nonprofit organization with a mission that celebrates creative and community use of media and the airwaves. Wave Farm (an assumed name of free103point9 Inc.) is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization and contributions made to the organization are tax-deductible. 
</p><p>
Fundraising 
</p><p>
All donations solicited on behalf of WGXC are used to meet the operating expenses of WGXC. Funds shall be solicited in a respectful manner, without pressure, and with the permission of the Station Manager prior to beginning any fundraising activities. 
</p><p>
Those soliciting donations or promoting station fundraising events on behalf of WGXC are acting as represents of the station and as such, are expected to conduct themselves in a respectful, professional manner, consistent with station policies.
</p><p>
In general, donor-designated restrictions on gifts to WGXC are undesirable. WGXC seeks to cultivate donors who are in support of the WGXC mission and program division at large. A culture of restricted donations can be crippling for an organization with significant regular operating costs like WGXC. Any donor-designated restrictions on contributions must be approved by the Station Manager and Executive Director before being accepted. 
</p><p>
Programmers and Volunteers who wish to have an active role in fundraising, beyond Pledge Drive activities, are invited to join the Fundraising Events and Donor Cultivation Committee, and may do so by expressing interest to the Station Manager. 
</p><p>
Fundraising Events and Donor Cultivation Committee 
</p><p>
Responsibilities include: <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Provide leadership with regards to fundraising events and major donor gifts <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Set and meet annual fundraising goals <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Establish and manage an annual gala event<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Secure matching donations from major donors during WGXC Pledge Drives 
</p><p>
Outreach 
</p><p>

WGXC shall work to continuously serve the diverse populations in our listening community. WGXC shall work to achieve this goal by ensuring that our mission is reflected in the makeup of the station’s Community Council, Staff, Community Programming Schedule, and all audience outreach activities. WGXC will maintain a regular dialogue with community organizations and elected governmental entities within its listening area. It will also maintain open dialogue with all other local organizations that demonstrate an interest in the participatory and inclusive project that is WGXC. Programmers and Volunteers who wish to have an active role in station Outreach are invited to join the Outreach Committee, and may do so by expressing interest to the Outreach Coordinator. 
</p><p>
Outreach Committee 
</p><p>
Responsibilities include: <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Set and meet semi-annual goals about engaging new audiences<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Create and conduct listener and/or focus group events<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Hold a series of gatherings at various locations within the listening area and spread the word about WGXC to cultivate new listeners and volunteers<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ensure representation in the community whether staffing a table at a community event, speaking to a group about the station, or attending events with a WGXC hat on<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Organize WGXC Listener events including an annual party, which serves as an opportunity for WGXC supporters to provide input on station matters and submit nominations to the advisory WGXC Community Council
</p>
<h2><a id="volunteering"></a>Volunteering</h2>
<p>
Volunteer Policy and Agreement
</p><p>
Thank you for volunteering your time and talents to WGXC 90.7 FM. As a non-commercial community radio station, volunteers are an essential part of our operations. 
</p><p>
Individuals interested in volunteering at WGXC should contact the Outreach Coordinator, providing their contact information, a description of their skills, and the kind of volunteer work desired. The Outreach Coordinator will direct the prospective volunteer to the appropriate staff member based upon this information. All volunteers are required to read and sign this WGXC Volunteer Policy. 
</p><p>
The Outreach Coordinator – with support from WGXC’s Staff – is responsible for providing volunteers with the information and support neessary to be able to do good work on behalf of the organization. WGXC’s Outreach Coordinator will assign tasks to available and interested volunteers, which may include activities such as assisting WGXC with on-air pledge drives and organizing or staffing fundraisers or other WGXC events. 
</p><p>
WGXC Volunteer Guidelines: <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Be reliable and punctual when assisting with an activity or event, and be loyal and respectful to the mission and values of the station. <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Identify yourself as a volunteer of WGXC when attending any station event or otherwise being publicly affiliated with the station. <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Secure prior authorization from a Staff member to meet with public officials on station business, speak on behalf of the station in the media, or receive contributions on behalf of WGXC. <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Use station computers, phones, and office supplies for station-related purposes only. <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Volunteers are not authorized to make expenditures on behalf of WGXC; consult a WGXC Staff member if such a need arises. 
</p><p>
Volunteers are not employees of WGXC and/or Wave Farm, and should notify the Outreach Coordinator if at any point they no longer wish to volunteer at WGXC. Likewise, while WGXC appreciates the support and dedication of its volunteers, it has the discretion to stop using individuals as volunteers at any time. 
</p><p>
Thank you again for your interest in volunteering at WGXC.

<h2><a id="underwriting"></a>Underwriting</h2>
<p></p>
WGXC will entertain underwriting and website advertisements from businesses with interests in the listening area. WGXC reserves the right to deny underwriting which is in opposition to the values and mission of WGXC and/or Wave Farm. An underwriting contract will be signed by all participating entities. Website ads will appear as business logos and link to the business website. Current underwriting rates appear on the <a href="/support#underwriting">WGXC website.</a>
</p>
<h2><a id="dispute"></a>Dispute & Complaint Resolution</h2>

<p>
This set of procedures is intended to guide WGXC’s programmers and volunteers who wish to express their concerns regarding the station’s policies, procedures, and performance. 
</p><p>
Timing: In order for a dispute or complaint to qualify for processing under this section, it must be filed no later than thirty (30) calendar days after the date on which the aggrieved condition commenced. 
</p><p>
Procedure: <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Step One: A programmer must submit their dispute or complaint in writing to the Program Director for discussion and action. Volunteers, who are not programmers, must contact the Outreach Coordinator in writing for discussion and action. <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Step Two: If the complainant finds the outcome of Step One unsatisfactory, or was unable to engage in Step One because the complainant was uncomfortable raising the issue with the specified contact, the written dispute or complaint should be submitted to the Station Manager for discussion and action. <br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Step Three: If the issue has not been resolved by Steps One or Two, the complainant should submit their written dispute or complaint to the Executive Director. The Executive Director will alert Wave Farm’s Board of Directors to the situation, and may choose to convene a meeting with the complainant and relevant parties. The Executive Director shall respond to the complainant in writing with a final decision. 
</p><p>
In all instances, a thorough and fair investigation will take place, giving careful consideration to the rights and dignity of all of those involved in a complaint or dispute.
