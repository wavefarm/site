You were organized & that space couldn't be better for a record show. Load-in and out was super easy<br><br>
Courtesy, friendliness, hospitality and spacing of tables<br><br>
Great organization and layout, interesting venue. Everyone is great to work with<br><br>
Loved the room and the general vibe was great<br><br>
Nice large room with open areas for shopping<br><br>
I found the event to be both easy (load in, load out, etc..) and very enjoyable! Great people! Great space!<br><br>
Very organized.<br><br>
Advertising, communication with vendors, room set up, table cost - Excellent job!!<br><br>
Orgazational skills were top notch from planning the show through to setup.<br><br>
