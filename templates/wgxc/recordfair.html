					<b>Hausu Mountain</b>: With one tentacle threaded through the US noise underground and one ear fixed on a worldwide online network of freak-friendly minds, the Hausu Mountain label has pumped a diverse menu of experimental music from its volcanic peak at a steady clip since 2012. Founded in Chicago by musicians and roommates Doug Kaplan (who records as MrDougDoug) and Max Allison (who records as Mukqs), the label originally served as a home for their own projects, including the trio Good Willsmith. As Kaplan and Allison discover new projects from touring the DIY circuit and scraping through the strangest corners of the internet, the label’s wide catalog grows to encompass everything from otherworldly synthesizer composition to frantic beat production in the IDM tradition to strains of free jazz infused with electronics alongside horns or drums – onward through any number of genre-bending mutations you might find in the “???” or “Avant/Noise” bin in your local record store. As much as Hausu Mountain’s releases diverge in terms of style, the label’s aesthetic hinges on the conception of music as a force to both challenge listeners and entertain them in equal measure. Any given release resists stasis, skips at will through disparate musical vocabularies, and leads listeners through dense sonic narratives that defy expectations as each new idea or unpredictable juxtaposition pierces through the cosmic jelly. In addition to LPs and cassettes from the label, we will have a selection of used records culled from our personal collections and adventures. </p>

<p>
					<b>Rewind Intl / Gridspace</b>: LPs, 45s and CDs from cheap items to collectibles ranging in genres from Jazz, Classic Rock, Psych, Garage, Punk, Post-punk, Industrial, International, Electronic and much more. Will also have vintage posters from 1960's - 90's, books and assorted music gear.</p>

<p>
					<b>John Doe Records and Books</b>: Obscure and not so obscure records, cassettes, books and also ephemera that perfectly blends in with the historical yet forward thinking tradition of Hudson, brought to you by Dan Bunny.</p>

<p>
				<b>Bittersweet Candy</b>: Hand made, small batch, record fair related chocolates, candies & unique gifts</p>
