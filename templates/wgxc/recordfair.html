Wave Farm’s WGXC 90.7-FM presents the WGXC Record Fair 2018 in partnership with Basilica Hudson. Vendors from across the northeast gather in Basilica’s Main Hall to sell vinyl, CDs, cassette tapes, DVDs, plus books, musical equipment and instruments, and radio-related ephemera. The plentiful WGXC tables are a digger’s dream, with a variety of affordably priced records in all genres.

The WGXC Record Fair coincides with Basilica SoundScape (Sept 14-16), an immersive, innovative weekend of art, music, and culture, which draws an audience in the thousands. Conceptual sound performances, author readings, installations, collaborations, curated local vendors and artisans, and on-site activities. Info at basilicahudson.org/soundscape.
