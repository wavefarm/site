<h1><a id="volunteer"></a>BECOME A WGXC VOLUNTEER</h1>
<p>WGXC is made possible by hardworking volunteers. Everything heard on 90.7-FM is the result of volunteer effort. From mending broken headphone cables, shoveling snow to provide access to the studios, recording town meetings and events, and being on the air sharing music and words, volunteers keep this station going. You don't have to know anything about radio or audio production to make a difference - WGXC needs you just as you are! Volunteering for WGXC is a free and fun way to learn new skills and meet your neighbors. Our volunteer meetings are friendly and open to the public. Come by, hear what we're planning for the next month, and get a sense of what it takes to keep the radio station working. Before you know it, you'll be participating in this hands-on media project.
</p><p>
How can your skills help WGXC? Can you answer a phone and say "Good morning, WGXC"? Or sit at a table during a townwide event and tell people about community radio? Put up a flier at your workplace, or favorite local hang? Bring a Zoom recorder to your next town or school board meeting? All of this helps keep WGXC on the air, and working at its best for our communities. 
</p><p>
WGXC Volunteer Meetings<br />
WGXC volunteer gatherings occur monthly, and are a way to meet and touch base with other members of the WGXC family. If you would like to volunteer and can't attend these meetings, please contact Outreach Coordinator Jess Puglisi at Jess [at] wgxc.org. 
</p><p>
Outreach Volunteers help the staff and station get the word out about WGXC to more people in our communities. This includes planning and implementing events and fundraisers, and representing WGXC at community events such as parades, fairs, and expos. You can also help bring new people onto WGXC by bring a Zoom recorder to the events you already attend, or organize. Outreach Volunteers can also help to support WGXC pledge drives. To get involved, contact Jess [at] wgxc.org.
</p><p>
Cleaning &amp; Maintenance<br />
Are you handy with a hammer? Proudly obsessive compulsive, with a tendency to make every surface sparkle? Drive a truck that makes frequent dump runs? Operating a radio station can get messy, and we sometimes break things. Add your name to the list of handy-people we can call next time we break a window, or join forces with others to rotate cleaning tasks in the Hudson or Catskill studios. Get in touch!
</p><p>
Archive &amp; Technical<br />
If you are savvy with data management, we can train you to become a specialized archive assistant. Or, if you feel better with a soldering iron and a circuit board, or have radio engineer experience (or want to get some), get in touch with Jess [at] wgxc.org or Station Manager Lynn Sloneker at lynn [at] wgxc.org to get involved.
</p><p>
Office Staffing<br />
Spend some time during the week helping out around the Hudson studio. We get phone calls throughout the week, many of which are just curious individuals who want to learn more about WGXC. You can help us answer these questions, and also help out with other tasks as they come along. Drop a line to Jess [at] wgxc.org to find out when you can help out.
</p><p>
Event Documentation<br />
Are you a photographer, or video maker? WGXC needs talented and trainable people to document the events we are co-presenting throughout Greene and Columbia counties. Contribute and reach thousands of viewers/listeners through the WGXC website, where visual documentation will be featured. If you are interested in documenting WGXC events, please contact jess@wgxc.org.
</p><p>
Town Recorders<br />
WGXC volunteers can record town meetings, candidate forums, performances, workshops, lectures, and other events throughout Greene and Columbia counties to air on WGXC 90.7-FM. WGXC will also train volunteers interested in producing other kinds of content and lend out equipment. Interviews, text stories, feature reports, audio and video news stories, oral histories, and other forms will be created by trained volunteers. This will allow community members to share more information about their local government, their neighbors, and issues and stories of interest. Contact Jess Puglisi at Jess [at] wgxc.org for more information about becoming a WGXC Town Recorder.
