<h1><a id="underwriting"></a>WGXC UNDERWRITING</h1>
<p>
Why underwrite with WGXC? Underwriting is a unique opportunity to reach WGXC’s 78,000 potential listeners on 90.7-FM, and thousands more who regularly visit wgxc.org. WGXC’s listeners believe in the importance of local media, and support the local businesses and organizations that support us. Our listeners are engaged and informed consumers; they value and recognize the investment made by local and regional businesses and organizations in support of community media.
</p><p>
What is underwriting? Underwriting is a specialized and non-commercial form of advertising. These on-air announcements are broadcast at the beginning of WGXC programs.
